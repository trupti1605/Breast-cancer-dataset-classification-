# Breast-cancer-dataset-classification-
### Introduction :-

The objective of the project was to build various models and compare their prediction performance based on accuracy.

- Built models trained on 

  1)Logistic regression

  2)SVM

  3)KNN

  4)Random forest.

- Data visualization is done by

  1)Count plot 

  2)Histogram 

  3)Heatmap 

  4)PaIn plot

  5)Boxplot

  6)Scatter plot 

- By comparing the prediction accuracy of these models, it was found that model trained on Random Forest performed the best in classifying the dataset.

- Tools used: Jupyter notebook

- Language: Python 3

- The dataset was imported from the scikit-learn package.
