# Breast-cancer-dataset-classification-
The objective of the project was to build various models and compare their prediction performance based on accuracy.
Built models trained on 
1)logistic regression

2)SVM

3)KNN

4) random forest.

Data visualization is done by

1)Count plot 

2)Histogram 

3)Heatmap 

4)PaIn plot

5)Boxplot

By comparing the prediction accuracy of these models, it was found that model trained on logistic regression performed the best in classifying the dataset.

Tools used: Jupyter notebook

Language: Python 3

The dataset was imported from the scikit-learn package.
